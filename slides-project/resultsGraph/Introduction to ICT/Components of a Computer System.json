      "title": "Memory: Short-Term Storage",
      "caption": "Next up: memory, also known as RAM. This is where the computer stores data it's actively using. The more RAM, the more you can do at once, smoothly. It's like a computer's short-term memory.",
      "prompt": "A stylized image of RAM modules, possibly glowing subtly. The background should suggest speed and data flow. Consider using abstract shapes and colors to represent data being stored and retrieved."

      "title": "Power Supply: Energizing the System",
      "caption": "The power supply provides electricity to all the components. It converts AC power from the wall into DC power the computer needs. Without it, nothing turns on!",
      "prompt": "An image of a power supply unit, perhaps partially disassembled to show its internal components. Highlight the cables and connections that deliver power to the rest of the system."

      "title": "The Operating System: The Conductor",
      "caption": "Finally, the operating system, like Windows, macOS, or Linux. It manages all the hardware and software, providing a user-friendly interface. It's the conductor of the computer's orchestra.",
      "prompt": "A visually appealing representation of an operating system interface. Consider using abstract shapes and colors to symbolize different functions and processes being managed."
