      "prompt": "A close-up shot of a Jay bird looking longingly towards a group of peacocks in the distance. The Jay's expression should convey a mix of admiration and envy.

      "prompt": "A medium shot of a Jay bird diligently collecting fallen peacock feathers scattered on the ground. Focus on the Jay's focused expression and the contrast between the dull feathers of the Jay and the vibrant peacock feathers. The setting should be a forest floor with leaves and twigs."

      "prompt": "An image showing the Jay bird meticulously attaching peacock feathers to its own body. The image should focus on the details of the feather attachment, showing the Jay using its beak and claws. The overall impression should be slightly awkward and unnatural."

      "caption": "But the peacocks saw through his disguise. They recognized he was not one of them.",
      "prompt": "A scene showing the Jay bird, adorned with peacock feathers, attempting to mingle with a group of peacocks. The peacocks are clearly rejecting him, perhaps displaying aloofness or even aggression. The Jay's expression should be changing from pride to uncertainty."

      "caption": "He tried to rejoin his own flock, but they no longer recognized him either.",
      "prompt": "An image depicting the Jay bird, still with some peacock feathers attached, attempting to return to a group of other Jay birds. The other Jay birds are shunning him, appearing confused and wary. The scene should emphasize the Jay's isolation."

      "prompt": "A dynamic image showing the Jay bird caught in a gust of wind. The peacock feathers are being blown away, revealing the plain Jay underneath. The scene should convey a sense of loss and exposure."

      "prompt": "A close-up, slightly upward angle shot of the Jay bird. It should be a clear, crisp image showing the details of the Jay's feathers and features. The bird should look directly at the viewer with an expression of confidence and self-acceptance. The lighting should be warm and inviting."
    },
    {
      "title": "True Beauty Within",
      "caption": "True beauty comes from within, not from borrowed appearances.",
      "prompt": "A split-screen image. One side shows the Jay awkwardly wearing peacock feathers, looking uncomfortable.
