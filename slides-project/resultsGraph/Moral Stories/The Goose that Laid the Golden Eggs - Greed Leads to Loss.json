      "title": "The Farmer's Greed - Start",
      "caption": "Once upon a time, there was a farmer… who owned a very special goose.",
      "prompt": "A simple, slightly cartoonish illustration of a humble farmer standing in front of a small, cozy barn at sunrise. He looks content and perhaps a little naive. A single goose stands beside him."

    {
      "title": "The Golden Egg Discovery",
      "caption": "This goose laid a golden egg… every single day!",
      "prompt": "Close-up on the goose in the barn. One golden egg is visible near her, glistening in the soft morning light. The farmer is looking at the egg in amazement, eyes wide."

      "title": "Initial Prosperity",
      "caption": "The farmer grew richer… one egg at a time.",
      "prompt": "Illustration showing the farmer's house gradually improving. Initially a very simple hut, it slowly transforms into a slightly more comfortable dwelling. The farmer looks pleased, counting coins."

      "title": "Foolish Thought",
      "caption": "He thought, 'There must be a mountain of gold… inside the goose!'",
      "prompt": "A thought bubble above the farmer's head showing a large pile of golden eggs inside the goose's belly. The illustration should emphasize the farmer's distorted and unrealistic perception."

    {
      "title": "The Fatal Decision",
      "caption": "Driven by greed, he killed the goose… hoping to get rich quickly.",
      "prompt": "A silhouette of the farmer raising an axe towards the goose in the barn. The scene should be dark and ominous, suggesting the irreversible nature of his action. Focus on the action, not gore."

      "caption": "But inside, there was nothing… only disappointment.",
      "prompt": "The farmer kneeling beside the dead goose, looking shocked and dismayed. The goose's empty belly is visible. The golden egg from that day lies forgotten nearby."

      "prompt": "A simple, clean image of a single golden egg resting on a soft cushion, with a gentle light shining on it. The background is a neutral color, creating a sense of peace and contentment. The image should convey the value of appreciating what one already possesses."

      "caption": "Remember, patience and gratitude… are worth more than gold.",
      "prompt": "A split-screen image. On one side, the initial happy farmer and goose. On the other side, the desolate farmer and the dead goose. A subtle transition effect between the two sides can be implied. The overall tone is cautionary and reflective."
