      "prompt": "A regal-looking cat perched atop a stone wall, partially obscured by ivy, with a mischievous glint in its eye. Below, in a sun-drenched field, several small, anthropomorphic mice are dancing and playing, completely unaware of the cat's presence.

The cat's fur is ruffled, its eyes are downcast, and its tail is tucked between its legs. The mice are standing proudly, their weapons still raised. The background should be a close-up of the mouse village, showing signs of the recent battle but also a sense of resilience and victory."
