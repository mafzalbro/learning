      "prompt": "A vibrant sunrise scene. A weathered fisherman in a small wooden boat holding a glistening, miniature fish between his thumb and forefinger. The sea is calm, reflecting the colors of dawn. Focus on the contrast between the vast ocean and the minuscule fish."

    {
      "title": "The Plea",
      "caption": "...the fish pleaded, 'Let me go! I'm too small to eat, but I'll grow big and be worth more later!'",
      "prompt": "Close-up on the little fish in the fisherman's hand. Emphasize the fish's tiny size and its wide, pleading eyes. Add subtle details suggesting intelligence or sadness in its expression. Soft, diffused lighting."

      "prompt": "A split image. On one side, the little fish in the fisherman's hand, well-lit and clear. On the other side, a hazy, indistinct vision of a much larger fish swimming away in the distance. Subtle differences in contrast to show uncertainty."

      "title": "Lost Chances",
      "caption": "He threw the little fish back. Then, he fished all day but caught nothing else.",
      "prompt": "The fisherman's silhouette against the setting sun. He's empty-handed, looking out at the vast, empty sea. A sense of regret and missed opportunity hangs in the air. Muted colors, long shadows."
