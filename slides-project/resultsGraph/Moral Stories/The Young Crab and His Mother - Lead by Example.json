      "title": "Crab Lesson 1: Sideways Scuttle",
      "caption": "Mother crab watches her young son attempting to walk forward. \"Why are you walking sideways, son?\" she asks. \"Try walking straight!\"",
      "prompt": "A brightly lit, whimsical illustration of a young, small crab struggling to walk straight on a sandy beach. A larger, concerned-looking mother crab watches him from nearby. Focus on the contrast between their movements - the son's awkward sideways scuttle versus the *idea* of straight walking."

    {
      "title": "The Mother's Flaw",
      "caption": "The young crab replies, \"But mother, I don't know how! Show me how to walk straight!\" The mother hesitates.",
      "prompt": "A slightly more dramatic angle, focusing on the mother crab. The lighting is slightly softer. She looks thoughtful, almost hesitant. Her own posture should hint at her own sideways movement, although subtle. The son crab is still visible, looking expectantly at his mother."

      "caption": "The mother crab attempts to walk straight, but she too, can only scuttle sideways. She realizes her hypocrisy.",

      "caption": "She pauses, embarrassed and thoughtful. Sometimes, we don't realize our own flaws until we try to teach others.",
      "prompt": "Close-up on the mother crab's face. The image should convey a sense of embarrassment and introspection. The background is blurred to focus on her expression. Soft, diffused lighting."

    {
      "title": "Leading by Example (Failed)",
      "caption": "The other young crabs start laughing at the mother crab's failed attempt to walk straight.",
      "prompt": "Illustration featuring multiple young crabs surrounding the mother crab, some pointing and laughing. The mother crab looks down, disheartened. The setting is still the sandy beach but with more crabs in view."
    },
    {
      "title": "The Realization of Hypocrisy",
      "caption": "She understands the importance of leading by example. Her words hold no value if her actions contradict them.",
      "prompt": "Close-up on the mother crabâ€™s face, but with a determined look replacing the previous embarrassment.  Slightly sharper lighting. The background remains blurred."

    {
      "title": "A New Beginning",
      "caption": "The mother crab resolves to change her own behavior first. True change starts with oneself.",
      "prompt": "The mother crab now diligently practicing walking straight. It's still awkward, but there's a visible effort. The son crab is watching with encouragement."

      "title": "Small Steps Forward",
      "caption": "Slowly, she begins to improve. The young crab imitates her efforts, both struggling together to walk forward.",

      "prompt": "A serene, wide shot of the beach with the mother and son crab disappearing into the distance, walking straight along the shoreline. The image is peaceful and conveys a sense of resolution."
