      "title": "Divide and Conquer",
      "caption": "Think of a massive jigsaw puzzle. One person could take forever to complete it. But what if you split it among many? That's the essence of distributed computing. Each computer solves a piece of the problem.",
      "prompt": "A jigsaw puzzle representing a complex problem. Multiple hands (representing different computers) are shown working together to assemble the puzzle pieces, each hand focusing on a separate section. The finished puzzle should symbolize the solution."

      "title": "Fault Tolerance - Keeping Systems Running",
      "caption": "What happens if one computer fails? In a distributed system, others can take over. This built-in redundancy ensures reliability and keeps services running smoothly.",
      "prompt": "An image of multiple servers working together, where one server is highlighted as failing. Show the other servers seamlessly taking over its workload, ensuring the system remains operational. Use a color change or subtle animation to depict the takeover."

      "title": "The Cloud Computing Connection",
      "caption": "Cloud computing relies heavily on parallel and distributed infrastructure. It provides on-demand access to computing resources, making powerful tools available to everyone.",
      "prompt": "A stylized depiction of a cloud with interconnected servers within it. Show data flowing to and from the cloud, representing the accessibility and scalability provided by cloud computing. Use bright, inviting colors."
