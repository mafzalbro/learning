      "caption": "Ever wondered how electricity is stored? That's where capacitors come in! They're like tiny rechargeable batteries.  A capacitor simply comprises two conductive plates separated by an insulator. This insulator is called a dielectric. When voltage is applied, it stores electrical energy in the form of an electric field. Capacitors are crucial in electronics, from smartphones to power grids!",
      "prompt": "An exploded diagram of a parallel-plate capacitor. Show the two conductive plates, the dielectric material between them, and arrows indicating the flow of charge when voltage is applied. The diagram should be clean, well-labeled, and visually appealing, emphasizing the components' relationship to each other."

      "title": "Water Analogy for Capacitance",
      "caption": "Think of capacitance like a water tank.  A wider tank holds more water. Similarly, a capacitor with a larger capacitance stores more charge at the same voltage.  The more it can hold, the higher its capacitance! Understanding this simple analogy makes grasping complex circuits much easier.",
      "prompt": "A split-screen image. On one side, a variety of water tanks (tall, short, wide, narrow) are being filled with water. On the other side, corresponding capacitors of different physical sizes are being charged. The water level should correspond to the voltage, and the tank size to the capacitance."

      "caption": "What about that insulator between the plates? It's called the dielectric.  Different materials have different dielectric constants.  A higher dielectric constant means more charge can be stored. It essentially boosts the capacitor's ability! The right dielectric is key for performance.",

      "title": "Capacitance Formula (Visual Representation)",
      "caption": "Capacitance, measured in Farads, depends on the plate area and the distance between them.   Larger area means more charge storage.  Smaller distance, a stronger electric field.  These factors directly impact how much energy a capacitor holds! C equals epsilon times A over d.  Simple!",
      "prompt": "An animated infographic illustrating the capacitance formula: C = ÎµA/d. Show how increasing the plate area (A) increases capacitance, and how decreasing the distance (d) between the plates also increases capacitance. Use clear visual cues to demonstrate the relationships."

      "title": "Capacitor Charging & Discharging",
      "caption": "Capacitors charge and discharge, a dance of electrons.  When charging, electrons flow onto one plate.  When discharging, they flow back, releasing stored energy.  This cycle repeats rapidly in many circuits.  It's the fundamental process powering countless applications!",
      "prompt": "An animated circuit diagram showing a capacitor charging through a resistor from a DC voltage source.  Visually represent the flow of electrons, the increasing voltage across the capacitor, and the decreasing current as the capacitor charges. Then, reverse the animation to show the discharge process."
