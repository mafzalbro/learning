      "title": "Visualizing Magnetic Fields Around a Bar Magnet",
      "caption": "Ever wondered what a magnetic field looks like? \nIt's an invisible force that surrounds magnets. \nSee the iron filings? \nThey align along the field lines. \nStrongest at the poles, \nweakest further away. \nA magnetic field in action!",
      "prompt": "A bar magnet lying horizontally on a white surface. Iron filings are sprinkled around the magnet, clearly showing the pattern of the magnetic field lines. Use shallow depth of field to focus on the magnet and the filings, blurring the background slightly.  High-resolution image, macro photography, science demonstration aesthetic."

      "caption": "Our planet has its own magnetic field! \nIt's called the magnetosphere. \nIt protects us from harmful solar winds. \nCharged particles get deflected. \nThis keeps our atmosphere safe. \nEarth, the magnetically shielded planet!",
      "prompt": "A stylized, artistic representation of Earth surrounded by its magnetosphere. The solar wind is depicted as streams of colorful particles being deflected by the magnetosphere. The Earth should be a vibrant blue and green. Use a space art aesthetic with nebulas and stars in the background."

      "caption": "Electricity and magnetism are linked! \nA coil of wire creates a magnetic field when current flows. \nThis is an electromagnet. \nSee it lifting metal objects? \nStronger current, stronger magnet. \nElectromagnets are used everywhere!",
      "prompt": "An electromagnet (a coil of wire wrapped around an iron core) actively lifting several metallic objects (paperclips, screws, small washers). The electromagnet should have wires connected to a visible battery. Focus on the lifting action and the magnetic attraction.  Practical science demonstration style."

      "caption": "The compass, a simple but powerful tool! \nIts needle aligns with Earth's magnetic field. \nPointing towards magnetic north. \nA reliable guide for navigation. \nHelping us find our way. \nThanks to magnetic fields!",
      "prompt": "A close-up shot of a compass needle clearly pointing towards North. The compass rose is visible and detailed. The background is a blurred landscape, perhaps a forest or mountains. The focus should be sharp on the needle and the North marking.  Nature photography style."

      "caption": "Magnets can attract or repel! \nLike poles repel each other. \nSee them pushing away? \nIt's the magnetic fields interacting. \nCreating a force between them. \nOpposites attract, likes repel!",
      "prompt": "Two bar magnets placed close to each other with their like poles facing each other, visibly repelling. The magnets should be suspended or resting on a low-friction surface so the repulsion is evident. Perhaps use a split-screen effect to highlight each magnet individually before showing them repelling.  Simple demonstration setup."
