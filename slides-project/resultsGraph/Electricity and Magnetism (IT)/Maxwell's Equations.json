      "prompt": "A visually appealing representation of interacting electric and magnetic fields. Consider using vibrant colors to differentiate the fields, with lines of force clearly depicted. The composition should convey a sense of energy and dynamism, but remain uncluttered and easy to understand. Perhaps a stylized lightning bolt as a focal point."

      "title": "Gauss's Law for Electricity: Charge Creates Fields",
      "caption": "First, Gauss's Law for Electricity. Electric charge is the source of electric fields. The more charge, the stronger the field. Think of it like ripples in a pond, emanating from a central point.",

The density of the lines should increase closer to the charge, illustrating the relationship between charge density and field strength. The background should be simple and uncluttered, focusing attention on the charge and its field."

Instead of directly writing the equations, use abstract symbols that suggest the concepts of electric charge, magnetic dipoles, changing fields, and the relationships between them. The overall impression should be one of order, beauty, and profound insight."
