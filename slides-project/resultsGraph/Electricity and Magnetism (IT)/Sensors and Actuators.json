      "title": "Sensor Array Visual",
      "caption": "Welcome to the world of sensors and actuators! These tiny components are the unsung heroes of modern technology. Sensors detect changes in their environment. Think of them as electronic eyes and ears. They measure things like temperature, pressure, and light. This data is then used to control actuators. Actuators are the muscles of the system. They perform actions based on sensor input. They can move things, turn things on and off, and much more. Together, sensors and actuators enable automation. From robots to smart homes, they're essential for a connected world. Join us as we explore this fascinating field!",
      "prompt": "A visually striking, clean image depicting a diverse array of sensors (temperature, pressure, light, motion) arranged neatly. The sensors should be visually distinct but clearly related. Background is a clean, futuristic cityscape faintly blurred. Focus on showcasing variety and technological sophistication without overwhelming detail. No text on the image itself."

Different types exist, like electric motors and pneumatic cylinders. Electric motors provide rotational motion. Pneumatic cylinders provide linear motion using compressed air. Consider a robotic arm: Actuators power its joints. Or an automated valve: Actuators control the flow of fluids. Actuators are essential for bringing automation to life.",
