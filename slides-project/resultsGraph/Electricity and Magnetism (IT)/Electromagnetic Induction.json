      "title": "Magnet Moving Through Coil",
      "caption": "Narrator: Ever wonder how electricity is made without batteries? It's all about movement! Watch as a magnet enters this coil of wire. Notice anything?",
      "prompt": "A clear, brightly lit animation showing a bar magnet moving into and out of a coil of copper wire. Highlight the magnetic field lines emanating from the magnet. The coil should be connected to a galvanometer (or ammeter) that shows a deflection when the magnet moves. Emphasize simplicity and clarity."

      "title": "Changing Magnetic Field",
      "caption": "Narrator: A moving magnet creates a changing magnetic field. This changing field is the key! It's the force behind our free electricity.",
      "prompt": "Abstract and colorful visualization of a magnetic field expanding and contracting around a coil of wire. The field lines should pulsate and change color dynamically. Avoid literal representation of magnets or wires; focus on the abstract representation of the field."
    },
    {
      "title": "Electrons in Motion",
      "caption": "Narrator: This changing field pushes the electrons inside the wire! They start to flow, creating an electric current.",
      "prompt": "Microscopic view inside a copper wire, with electrons represented as small glowing particles. Show the electrons randomly moving when the magnetic field is absent, and then flowing in a directed manner (a current) when a magnetic field (represented by subtle lines) is introduced. Use a contrasting color for the electrons and the wire."

    {
      "title": "Generator Schematic",
      "caption": "Narrator: This principle is used in generators. Simple generators use coils that rotates within a magnetic field, producing electricity.",
      "prompt": "A simplified diagram of a basic electrical generator. Show a coil of wire rotating between the poles of a magnet. Clearly indicate the flow of current generated by the rotating coil. Label the key components: coil, magnet, and output terminals."

    {
      "title": "Hydroelectric Dam Example",
      "caption": "Narrator: Think about big hydroelectric dam. Water spins a turbine, which rotates coils, creating energy for your home.",
      "prompt": "A visually appealing image of a hydroelectric dam, showing water flowing through turbines. Highlight the turbine blades spinning. Use bright colors and a clean, modern style. Subtly indicate the flow of electricity from the dam."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wind Turbine Example",
      "caption": "Narrator: Wind farms work in a similar way. The spinning blades power a generator inside the turbine to give us renewable power.",
      "prompt": "A wide shot of a wind farm with several wind turbines. Focus on one turbine, subtly illustrating the spinning blades and the generation of electricity within the turbine's housing. A sunny sky and green fields in the background to convey renewable energy."

      "title": "Wireless Charging Pad",
      "caption": "Narrator: Even wireless charging uses electromagnetic induction. A coil in the charger creates field that transfers power to the device.",
      "prompt": "Close-up image of a smartphone charging on a wireless charging pad. Show a subtle glow between the phone and the pad, indicating the transfer of energy. The pad should have a modern, sleek design."

    {
      "title": "Transformer Diagram",
      "caption": "Narrator: Transformers use two coils to change voltage using electromagnetic induction. Essential for distributing electricity.",
      "prompt": "A simplified diagram of a transformer, showing two coils wrapped around an iron core. Illustrate the magnetic field lines linking the two coils. Clearly label the primary and secondary coils, and indicate the voltage transformation (e.g., input voltage lower than output voltage)."

    {
      "title": "Electromagnetic Induction in Daily life",
      "caption": "Narrator: So, next time you turn on a light, remember the power of electromagnetic induction. It is really helpful and amazing in real life!",
      "prompt": "A montage of everyday items that utilize electromagnetic induction: a light bulb, a phone charging wirelessly, and the electric grid. Focus on clean, modern designs and bright colors."
