It's likely Alternating Current, or AC. \n\n**(Scene: The AC waveform on the right becomes more prominent, showing the sinusoidal shape.)**\n\n**Voiceover:** Unlike batteries providing a steady, direct current, AC electricity constantly changes direction. Think of it as a wave, rising and falling.\n\n**(Scene: A simple animation showing electrons moving back and forth in a wire connected to an AC source.)**\n\n**Voiceover:** This back-and-forth movement is what defines AC, making it efficient for long-distance power transmission. \n\n**(Scene: A montage of various appliances like a refrigerator, microwave, and phone charger.)**\n\n**Voiceover:** From your fridge to your phone charger, AC powers countless devices in our daily lives. Understanding AC is understanding the foundation of modern electricity.",

A vertical line sweeps across, marking cycles.)**\n\n**Voiceover:** In AC circuits, 'frequency' describes how often the current changes direction per second. \n\n**(Scene: Two sine waves are displayed side by side. One has a higher frequency (more cycles) than the other.)**\n\n**Voiceover:** Measured in Hertz (Hz), a higher frequency means more cycles per second. For example, 60 Hz means the current changes direction 60 times per second! \n\n**(Scene: An animation showing a simple circuit changing its AC frequency, with a corresponding change in the speed of a small motor connected to it.)**\n\n**Voiceover:** Different appliances are designed for specific frequencies. Understanding frequency is crucial for circuit design and safety.",

But, inductors and capacitors can cause a 'phase shift'. \n\n**(Scene: Simple illustrations representing inductors and capacitors. Short, clear labels are visible.)**\n\n**Voiceover:** Inductors cause current to 'lag' behind voltage, while capacitors cause current to 'lead'.
