      "caption": "Gauss's Law: the dance of electric fields. Imagine an invisible sphere... surrounding a charge. Electric field lines pierce its surface. More lines, stronger field. Gauss's Law quantifies this relationship. The total electric flux... is proportional to the enclosed charge. Simple yet powerful.",
      "prompt": "A visually striking illustration of a positive point charge at the center of a transparent sphere. Electric field lines are radiating outwards from the charge, piercing the surface of the sphere. Use vibrant colors to differentiate the charge, field lines, and sphere. The background should be clean and uncluttered, allowing the visual to be the primary focus."

The electric field... multiplied by the area. Gauss's Law simplifies complex calculations. A fundamental tool in electromagnetism.",
      "prompt": "A charged metallic sphere enclosed by a larger, transparent spherical Gaussian surface. Indicate the area vector (dA) and electric field vector (E) at a representative point on the Gaussian surface.

Consider a light background to make the equation easily readable."
