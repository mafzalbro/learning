      "caption": "Welcome! Ever wonder what makes a brand stick? It's often rooted in archetypes. The Hero: Courageous and inspiring. The Innocent: Pure and optimistic. The Rebel: Breaking norms, challenging the status quo. Understanding these archetypes helps shape a brand's voice and personality, resonating with its target audience. Identify your brand's archetype. Connect deeper. Build stronger.",

It's not just a logo, it's the whole experience.",

Visualize key elements of brand identity: Logo (depicted as a simple, stylized logo), Color Palette (a spectrum of coordinated colors), Typography (examples of different fonts), Voice (a speech bubble with a short, impactful phrase), Imagery (a placeholder image hinting at visual style). Connect these elements with subtle lines or arrows, emphasizing their interconnectedness. Maintain a professional and modern aesthetic."

      "prompt": "A symbolic representation of brand values. Visualize a strong, central pillar representing 'Brand'.

      "prompt": "A visual depiction of a classic narrative arc (Freytag's Pyramid). Each stage of the arc (Exposition, Rising Action, Climax, Falling Action, Resolution) should be represented by a distinct visual element or icon.
