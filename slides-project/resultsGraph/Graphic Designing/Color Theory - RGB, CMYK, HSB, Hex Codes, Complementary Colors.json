These three primary colors combine to create a vast spectrum of colors on your screens. Adjust the levels and see the magic happen. Think of it as the secret ingredient in all digital art!",
      "prompt": "A vibrant, animated RGB color wheel. The primary colors (Red, Green, Blue) are clearly labeled. As the wheel rotates, show how they blend to create secondary and tertiary colors. Simple, clean design. Minimal background distractions."

Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black. This is the color model for printing. The more colors, the more deep they become. It's how printers bring your digital designs to life, ensuring accurate color reproduction on paper.",
      "prompt": "A visually engaging simulation of CMYK color mixing. Show Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black ink cartridges feeding into a mixing container. As the inks combine, display the resulting color and its CMYK values. Focus on the subtractive nature of CMYK."

Blue and Orange, Red and Green, Yellow and Purple. They create strong contrast and visual impact. Using them adds dimension, excitement and makes for very good designs",
      "prompt": "An illustration showcasing several pairs of complementary colors (e.g., Red/Green, Blue/Orange, Yellow/Purple). Each pair should be displayed side-by-side, with a visual element (e.g., a connecting line or shape) emphasizing their relationship. Use simple shapes and a clean background."

Learn to control and get the colors to the way you want to see them",
      "prompt": "Start with a visually interesting full-color image (e.g., a flower or a landscape). Deconstruct it into its individual Red, Green, and Blue color channels, displayed as grayscale images. Show the separate channels blending back together to recreate the original full-color image.

CMYK printing presses lay down layers of ink, starting with Cyan, then Magenta, then Yellow and lastly Black. The combination produces all the amazing photos. ",
      "prompt": "An animated visualization of the CMYK printing process. Show each of the four CMYK inks (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black) being applied in sequence to create a final printed image. Emphasize the layering effect and how the different inks combine to produce a full range of colors."

Analogous colors. These colors sit beside each other on the color wheel. They often create calming colour effects and are seen within nature. ",
      "prompt": "A color wheel highlighting a set of analogous colors (e.g., blue, blue-green, green). Visually emphasize the closeness of these colors on the wheel. Use a simple and uncluttered design. Label \"Analogous Colors\" clearly."

This scheme uses a base color and the two colors adjacent to its complement. This provides a high contrast but not as strong as complementary colors. Use these schemes to create more interesting and beautiful visuals",
      "prompt": "A clean visual representation of a split complementary color scheme. Choose a dominant color and then show the two colors that flank its complement on the color wheel. Use a visually pleasing arrangement and label each color. For example Blue with Yellow-Orange and Red-Orange."
