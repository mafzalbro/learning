      "title": "The Untouched Photograph",
      "caption": "Hey there! Want to make your photos pop? Let's dive into basic photo editing. First up: Exposure! Too dark? Too bright? Adjust it! Next, Contrast. Add depth and dimension to your image. Now, let's talk White Balance. Get rid of those unwanted color casts. Finally, a touch of Sharpening. Make those details crisp and clear. Simple, right? Now go make some magic!",
      "prompt": "A slightly underexposed photograph of a vibrant cityscape at sunset, before any editing has been applied. Focus on the colors and potential that the image holds."

      "prompt": "The same cityscape photo from the previous prompt, but now with the exposure properly adjusted to a pleasing level. Highlight the difference in vibrancy and detail."

    {
      "title": "Contrast Boost",

      "prompt": "The same cityscape photo, initially with a slightly blue tint, then corrected with adjusted white balance to show true colors. Showcase the impact of accurate white balance."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sharpening Details",
      "caption": "Sharpening is the final touch. It enhances the details and textures. But be careful! Too much sharpening can create unwanted noise. A subtle adjustment makes a big difference. It's the secret to a professional look!",
      "prompt": "The same cityscape photo, now with a subtle amount of sharpening applied, highlighting the crispness of buildings and other details. Avoid excessive sharpening artifacts."

      "prompt": "A close-up portrait of a person with a few small blemishes on their face. An indication showing the spot removal tool being used to subtly remove one of the blemishes."

    {
      "title": "Saturation Adjustment",

      "prompt": "A split-screen image showing the original untouched cityscape photo on one side, and the fully edited version (with exposure, contrast, white balance, and sharpening adjustments) on the other side, clearly demonstrating the positive impact of basic photo editing."
