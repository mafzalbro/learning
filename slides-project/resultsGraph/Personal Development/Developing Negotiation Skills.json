      "title": "The Foundation: Active Listening",
      "caption": "Negotiation starts *before* you speak. Listen actively. Understand their needs, their fears, their perspective. You'll be surprised what you learn. Listening builds rapport, trust, and a foundation for a successful negotiation. So, listen first. Then, speak strategically.",
      "prompt": "A clean, professional image of a person intently listening to another person across a conference table. Focus on the body language conveying attentiveness and empathy: leaning forward, making eye contact, nodding slightly. The background should be blurred to emphasize the connection between the two individuals."
    },
    {
      "title": "Preparation is Paramount",
      "caption": "Walking into a negotiation unprepared is like walking into a boxing ring blindfolded. Do your research. Know your goals, your limits, and your alternatives. Understand *their* likely position, their motivations, and their potential weaknesses. Preparation empowers confidence. Confidence leads to better outcomes.",
      "prompt": "A well-organized desk with a laptop, notepad, pen, and research materials. A faint overlay of a blueprint or strategic plan in the background hints at the preparation involved. The scene should convey a sense of readiness and meticulous planning."

    {
      "title": "Define Your BATNA: Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement",
      "caption": "Before you negotiate, define your BATNA. What's your best option if the negotiation fails? Knowing your BATNA gives you power. It allows you to walk away from a bad deal. It's your safety net. Don't negotiate without knowing your BATNA.",
      "prompt": "An image depicting two paths diverging. One path leads to a closed door (representing a failed negotiation), the other leads to an open, bright landscape (representing a strong BATNA). The overall feeling should be empowering and emphasize the importance of having options."
    },
    {
      "title": "Find Common Ground: Shared Interests",
      "caption": "Negotiation isn't always about conflict. Look for common ground. Shared interests create a bridge. Focus on areas where you both benefit. Finding that common ground makes agreement easier and more likely. Build from strength, build from shared goals.",
      "prompt": "An image showing two hands, representing different parties, building a bridge together with interlocking blocks. The blocks should be bright and colorful, representing shared interests. The background should be neutral, focusing on the act of collaboration."
    },
    {
      "title": "Emotional Intelligence: Manage Your Reactions",
      "caption": "Emotions can derail a negotiation. Stay calm, even under pressure. Don't react impulsively. Recognize and manage your own emotions, and be aware of the emotions of the other party. Emotional intelligence is a superpower in negotiation.",
      "prompt": "A person meditating calmly in a serene environment. Subtle indicators of stress (e.g., a slightly furrowed brow) are present, but the overall impression is one of control and composure. The color palette should be calming and peaceful."
    },
    {
      "title": "Communicate Clearly and Assertively",
      "caption": "Don't be afraid to state your needs clearly and assertively. But, be respectful. Avoid aggression. Use 'I' statements to express your perspective. Communicating clearly minimizes misunderstandings and maximizes the chances of a positive outcome.",
      "prompt": "A person confidently and calmly presenting their ideas to a group of people at a table. Their body language is open and receptive, but also firm and assured. The lighting should be professional and highlight the speaker's confidence."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be Creative: Explore Options",
      "caption": "Don't limit yourself to a win-lose mentality. Explore creative solutions. Think outside the box. Brainstorm different options. You might find a solution that benefits both parties more than either initially imagined. Innovation unlocks value.",
      "prompt": "A lightbulb illuminating above two people shaking hands. Gears and interconnected cogs are subtly visible in the background, symbolizing creative problem-solving. The overall tone should be optimistic and innovative."
    },
    {
      "title": "Know When to Walk Away",
      "caption": "Sometimes, the best negotiation is no negotiation. Know when to walk away. Don't be afraid to say no to a bad deal. Your time and energy are valuable. Walking away protects your interests and strengthens your position in future negotiations.",
      "prompt": "A person confidently turning away from a table where a negotiation is taking place. Their back is straight, and their expression is resolute. The overall image should convey a sense of strength and self-respect."
    },
    {
      "title": "Practice Makes Perfect: Continuous Improvement",
      "caption": "Negotiation is a skill. It requires practice. Analyze your past negotiations. Identify what worked and what didn't. Seek feedback. Continuously learn and improve. The more you practice, the better you'll become.",
      "prompt": "A person reviewing notes or a recording of a past negotiation, with a thoughtful and analytical expression. The scene should suggest reflection and a commitment to continuous improvement. A bookshelf with books on negotiation strategies can be visible in the background."
