      "caption": "Hello! Ever feel like you've messed up? Like a shattered vase? That's okay. It's human. Failure isn't the end. It's a chance to learn. To rebuild. Stronger. More beautiful. So pick up those pieces. What will you create?",
      "prompt": "A beautifully rendered, slightly cracked vase. The cracks are highlighted with gold kintsugi, suggesting repair and resilience. Soft lighting, slightly blurred background."

      "title": "Growing Taller Through Turbulence",
      "caption": "Imagine a young tree battered by a storm. It bends, almost breaks. But it doesn't. The wind strengthens its roots. Makes it more flexible. Failure is like that storm. Embrace the resistance. It makes you stronger. More resilient. A taller tree.",
      "prompt": "A young sapling bending in a strong wind. Focus on the roots being firmly planted in the ground. The sky is dramatic with dark clouds, but a ray of sunlight peeks through."

      "title": "The Unsuccessful Flight: A Stepping Stone",
      "caption": "That prototype didn't fly? The formula failed? Good! Now you know what *doesn't* work. Each failure is data. It guides you. Refines your approach. Every crash landing is a lesson in aerodynamics. Soar higher next time.",
      "prompt": "A whimsical illustration of a slightly broken, cartoonish flying machine (like a homemade glider) resting on the ground. Tools are scattered around it. The overall tone is optimistic and encouraging."

      "title": "The Iterative Painter: Layering Experience",
      "caption": "A painting isn't perfect from the first brushstroke. It's built layer by layer. Mistakes are painted over. Refined. Each layer informs the next. Failure is simply another layer. Making the final masterpiece richer and more meaningful.",
      "prompt": "A close-up of an oil painting in progress. Layers of different colors and textures are visible. Focus on the depth and the feeling of continuous evolution."

    {
      "title": "The Untangled Knot: Persistence Rewarded",
      "caption": "A knot seems impossible. Frustration builds. But you keep at it. Slowly, patiently. You learn to see the loops. The overlaps. Failure teaches you perseverance. Problem-solving. Until finally... untangled! Celebrate the process.",
      "prompt": "A close-up photo of a complex knot being slowly untangled by a pair of hands. The lighting is soft and focused on the hands and the knot."

      "title": "The Dented Armor: Scars of Victory",
      "caption": "Scared? Beat up and bruised? It's ok. Every scar tells a story. Shows the battles you've fought. Proof of your resilience. The dents in your armor are badges of honor. Wear them proudly. You're still standing.",
      "prompt": "A medieval suit of armor with visible dents and scratches. The armor is standing upright, bathed in warm, dramatic light. The overall impression is of strength and perseverance."

      "title": "The Replanted Seed: Second Chance to Grow",
      "caption": "That seed didn't sprout? Don't give up. Try again. Maybe the soil wasn't right. Maybe it needed more sunlight. Failure gives you clues. Provides new information. Replant that seed. Nurture it. Watch it grow.",
      "prompt": "A hand gently replanting a small seed into fresh soil. Focus on the nurturing aspect and the potential for growth."

      "title": "The Broken Pencil: Sharper for the Task",
      "caption": "Pencil broke? Annoying, right? But now it needs sharpening. Honing your skills. Refocusing your energy. Failure is a chance to sharpen your perspective. To become more precise. Ready to create again.",
      "prompt": "A broken pencil being sharpened to a sharp point. Focus on the contrast between the broken state and the newly sharpened point."

      "title": "Falling Upwards: A Path to Mastery",
      "caption": "It feels like falling, doesn't it? But what if you're falling... *upwards*? Each stumble, each mistake, is a step closer to mastery. Embrace the journey. The falls, the lessons. Keep climbing. You've got this.",
      "prompt": "A stylized illustration of a person climbing a staircase that appears to defy gravity. The overall impression is of upward movement and overcoming challenges."
