      "title": "Crossed Arms: Defensiveness or Comfort?",
      "caption": "Video script: (Scene: A person with crossed arms smiling slightly) 'Body language speaks volumes! Are crossed arms always a sign of defensiveness? Not necessarily! It can also indicate comfort or simply feeling cold. Context is key! Watch the facial expressions and surrounding situation for a clearer understanding.' (Transition: close up on the person's face showing relaxed features) 'Relaxed facial features suggest comfort, even with crossed arms.' (Transition: quick shot of a cold environment) 'If it's chilly, it's likely just warmth seeking behavior! Don't jump to conclusions!'",
      "prompt": "A person with crossed arms looking directly at the viewer, smiling subtly. Background should be neutral and slightly blurred. Add subtle cues like a slightly chilly looking environment (optional) or a relaxed expression."

      "title": "Eye Contact: Connection or Intimidation?",
      "caption": "Video script: (Scene: Two people making eye contact during a conversation) 'Eye contact is a powerful tool in communication. But its meaning isn't always straightforward! Prolonged eye contact can signal confidence and connection...'(Transition: Camera zooms slightly closer on one person's face showing intensity) '...or it can feel intimidating or aggressive.' (Transition: Camera pulls back showing the body language of both individuals) 'Consider the context and other body language cues. Are they smiling? Leaning in? Or tense and rigid? These are important signals.'",
      "prompt": "Two people engaged in a conversation, making eye contact. One person should be leaning slightly forward with a relaxed posture, while the other should have a more neutral posture. Use warm lighting and a conversational setting (e.g., coffee shop)."

      "title": "Posture: Confidence or Insecurity?",
      "caption": "Video script: (Scene: A split screen showing two figures. On one side, a person with slouched posture; on the other, a person with straight posture) 'Posture can be a dead giveaway of someone's emotional state! Upright posture often signals confidence and self-assurance...' (Transition: Focus on the slouched figure) '...while slumped shoulders and a bowed head can suggest insecurity, sadness, or fatigue.' (Transition: Quick shot of someone stretching and improving their posture) 'But remember, posture can be affected by many factors. Chronic pain, for instance.'",
      "prompt": "A split-screen image. On one side, a person standing with excellent posture (straight back, shoulders relaxed, head held high). On the other side, a person with slouched posture (rounded shoulders, head down). Backgrounds should be simple and contrasting."

      "caption": "Video script: (Scene: A montage of diverse faces showing basic emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise) 'Facial expressions are often considered a universal language of emotion. Happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust are generally recognized across cultures.' (Transition: Focus on one face showing subtle micro-expressions) 'But be mindful of cultural differences in the intensity and display of these emotions. And watch for microexpressions – fleeting, involuntary expressions that can reveal true feelings.' (Transition: Back to the montage emphasizing diversity)",
      "prompt": "A grid of diverse faces (different ethnicities, ages, genders) each displaying a clear and distinct emotion: happiness, sadness, anger, surprise. Use a clean, modern design."

      "title": "Gestures: Emphasizing or Distracting?",
      "caption": "Video script: (Scene: A person giving a presentation, using hand gestures effectively) 'Gestures can be powerful tools for emphasizing points and engaging your audience.' (Transition: Quick shot of a person fidgeting nervously) 'But excessive or distracting gestures can undermine your message. Fidgeting, touching your face, or waving your hands wildly can make you appear nervous or untrustworthy.' (Transition: Shot of the presenter using controlled, purposeful gestures) 'Use gestures intentionally and avoid nervous habits.'",
      "prompt": "A person giving a presentation. In the foreground, their hands are making a deliberate and engaging gesture. The background should be a slightly blurred presentation setting (e.g., conference room, stage)."

What feels comfortable in one culture might feel intrusive in another.' (Transition: Quick shot of someone stepping back uncomfortably) 'Be mindful of physical boundaries and observe how people react to your proximity. Are they leaning back? Shifting their weight? These are signs you might be too close.' (Transition: Shot of people maintaining a comfortable distance during conversation) 'Respecting personal space fosters trust and communication.'",
      "prompt": "Two people having a conversation, standing at a comfortable distance from each other. The background should be a common public space (e.g., park, sidewalk). Emphasis on a friendly and relaxed interaction."

      "title": "Mirroring: Building Rapport",
      "caption": "Video script: (Scene: Two people mirroring each other's body language in a conversation) 'Mirroring is a subconscious behavior where we subtly imitate another person's body language. It's a sign of connection and rapport.' (Transition: Slow motion shot of one person crossing their legs, followed by the other person doing the same subtly) 'When people are in sync, they often unconsciously mirror each other. It can be a powerful tool for building relationships.' (Transition: Wide shot showing two people in agreement)",
      "prompt": "Two people engaged in a conversation, subtly mirroring each other's body language (e.g., posture, hand gestures). Use a warm, inviting color palette and a setting that suggests a comfortable relationship (e.g., friends chatting at a coffee shop)."

      "caption": "Video script: (Scene: A person observing a group of people interacting) 'Body language is a complex and nuanced form of communication. Don't rely on a single cue! Look for patterns and clusters of behaviors.' (Transition: A visual diagram highlighting different body language cues like eye contact, posture, facial expression, and gestures) 'Consider the context, the individual's personality, and cultural background.' (Transition: Back to the person observing, now with a thoughtful expression) 'Becoming a skilled observer takes practice and empathy.'",
      "prompt": "A person observing a group of people interacting in a public space (e.g., a park, a café). The observer should have a thoughtful and attentive expression. The background should be slightly blurred to focus attention on the observer and their analysis."

Nodding, maintaining eye contact, and leaning slightly forward show you're paying attention.' (Transition: Close up on the active listener showing subtle cues of engagement) 'Avoid distracting behaviors like checking your phone or fidgeting. Your body language should signal that you're truly present and listening.' (Transition: Shot of the speaker feeling validated by the listener's actions)",
      "prompt": "Two people in a conversation. One person is actively listening, showing engagement through eye contact, nodding, and leaning forward. The other person is speaking with a relaxed and open posture. The setting should be a comfortable and inviting space, such as a living room or café."
