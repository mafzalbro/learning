You can see all the ingredients and the instructions, and you can change them to make it your own.</li>\n<li><strong>Key aspects:</strong><ul>\n<li><strong>Free access to the source code.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Freedom to modify and redistribute.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Community-driven development (often).</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n"

You might not have access to the source code.</li>\n<li><strong>Public Domain Software:</strong> Software with no copyright restrictions whatsoever.  Open Source licenses still have terms, even if they&#39;re permissive.</li>\n<li><strong>Just &#39;Free&#39; (as in price):</strong> While many OSS projects are free of charge, &#39;Open Source&#39; refers to the license and accessibility of the code, not just the cost.</li>\n</ul>\n"
