    "title": "What is a Network?",
    "content": "<p>Simply put, a network is a collection of devices (computers, phones, printers, etc.) connected together to share information and resources.</p>\n<p>Think of it like a group of friends who can talk to each other and share toys!</p>\n"
  },
  {
    "title": "Why Do We Need Networks?",
    "content": "<p>Networks allow us to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Share files and resources:</strong>  Easily transfer documents, pictures, and music.</li>\n<li><strong>Share internet access:</strong> One internet connection can be used by multiple devices.</li>\n<li><strong>Communicate:</strong> Send emails, instant messages, and make video calls.</li>\n<li><strong>Collaborate:</strong> Work together on projects simultaneously.</li>\n<li><strong>Centralized management:</strong> Easier to manage software and security updates.</li>\n</ul>\n"

  },
  {
    "title": "Types of Networks: Other",
    "content": "<p>There are other types of networks too:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):</strong> Larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN (e.g., connecting multiple buildings in a city).</li>\n<li><strong>WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network):</strong> A LAN that uses wireless technology (Wi-Fi).</li>\n<li><strong>VPN (Virtual Private Network):</strong> Creates a secure connection over a public network like the internet.</li>\n</ul>\n"

  {
    "title": "Network Topologies: Bus",
    "content": "<p><strong>Bus Topology:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>All devices are connected to a single cable (the &#39;bus&#39;).</li>\n<li>Simple to set up, but a break in the cable can disrupt the entire network.</li>\n<li>Not commonly used in modern networks due to its limitations.</li>\n</ul>\n"
  },
  {
    "title": "Network Topologies: Star",
    "content": "<p><strong>Star Topology:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>All devices are connected to a central hub or switch.</li>\n<li>Most common topology in modern LANs.</li>\n<li>Easy to troubleshoot and manage.</li>\n<li>If the central hub/switch fails, the entire network goes down.</li>\n</ul>\n"
  },
  {
    "title": "Network Topologies: Ring",
    "content": "<p><strong>Ring Topology:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Devices are connected in a circular loop.</li>\n<li>Data travels in one direction around the ring.</li>\n<li>A break in the ring can disrupt the entire network.</li>\n<li>Less common than star topology.</li>\n</ul>\n"
