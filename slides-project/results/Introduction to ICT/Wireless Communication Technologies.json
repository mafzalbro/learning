    "title": "What is Wireless Communication?",
    "content": "<p>Wireless communication is transmitting information without using physical wires or cables.  It relies on electromagnetic waves (like radio waves, microwaves, and infrared) to carry data through the air.</p>\n<p>Think of it like talking â€“ your voice travels through the air to reach someone else&#39;s ears.  Wireless communication does the same, but with digital information.</p>\n"
