    "title": "Memory Management (RAM)",
    "content": "<p>RAM (Random Access Memory) is used to store data and instructions that the CPU needs quickly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The OS allocates RAM to processes as needed.</li>\n<li>If RAM is full, the OS may use virtual memory (part of the hard drive) as an extension of RAM, but it&#39;s slower.</li>\n<li>Efficient memory management is crucial for system performance.</li>\n</ul>\n"
  },
  {
    "title": "File Systems",
    "content": "<p>A file system organizes data on storage devices (hard drives, SSDs).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It uses a hierarchical structure of directories (folders) and files.</li>\n<li>Examples: NTFS (Windows), APFS (macOS), ext4 (Linux).</li>\n<li>The OS provides tools to create, delete, and manage files and directories.</li>\n</ul>\n"
  },
