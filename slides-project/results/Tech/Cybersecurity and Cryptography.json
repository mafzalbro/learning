    "title": "What is Cybersecurity?",
    "content": "<p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, damage, or theft. It&#39;s like a digital bodyguard for your information.</p>\n<p>Think of it as locking your house, but for your online world.  It involves everything from strong passwords to complex security systems.</p>\n"

    "title": "Hashing: One-Way Function",
    "content": "<p>Hashing is a one-way cryptographic function that takes an input (e.g., a password) and produces a fixed-size string of characters (a hash value).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cannot be reversed:</strong> You can&#39;t get the original input from the hash value.</li>\n<li><strong>Used for password storage:</strong> Store the hash of the password, not the password itself.</li>\n<li><strong>Examples:</strong> SHA-256, SHA-3, MD5 (MD5 is considered insecure for password storage).</li>\n</ul>\n"

    "title": "Digital Signatures",
    "content": "<p>Digital signatures use cryptography to verify the authenticity and integrity of digital documents.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Uses asymmetric-key cryptography:</strong> The sender encrypts a hash of the document with their private key, creating a digital signature.</li>\n<li><strong>The recipient uses the sender&#39;s public key:</strong> To decrypt the signature and verify the document&#39;s integrity.</li>\n</ul>\n"
