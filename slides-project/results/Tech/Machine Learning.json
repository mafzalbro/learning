    "content": "<p>Machine Learning (ML) is a way to teach computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.</p>\n<p>Instead of writing specific rules, we give the computer data and let it figure out patterns and make predictions.</p>\n<p><strong>Analogy:</strong> Imagine teaching a dog tricks. You don&#39;t tell it <em>exactly</em> how to sit, but you reward it when it gets it right based on your feedback.</p>\n<p><strong>In simpler terms:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>ML = Learning from Data + Making Predictions</li>\n</ul>\n"
