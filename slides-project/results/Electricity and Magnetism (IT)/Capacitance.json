    "title": "How Capacitors Work: Charge Storage",
    "content": "<p>A capacitor typically consists of two conductive plates separated by an insulator (called a dielectric).</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Charging:</strong> When a voltage is applied, electrons accumulate on one plate (making it negatively charged) and are removed from the other plate (making it positively charged).</li>\n<li><strong>Electric Field:</strong> This separation of charge creates an electric field between the plates.</li>\n<li><strong>Storing Energy:</strong>  The electric field stores the electrical energy. The higher the Voltage the higher the charge and the higher energy.</li>\n<li><strong>Discharging:</strong> When the voltage source is removed and a path is provided, the electrons flow back, neutralizing the charge and releasing the stored energy.</li>\n</ol>\n"
