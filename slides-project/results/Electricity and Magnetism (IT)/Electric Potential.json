    "content": "<p>Before diving into electric potential, let&#39;s quickly recap electric potential energy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Potential Energy:</strong> The energy a charge possesses due to its position in an electric field.  Just like a ball held above the ground has gravitational potential energy.</li>\n<li><strong>Work Done:</strong> Moving a charge against an electric field requires work, increasing its potential energy. Conversely, a charge moving <em>with</em> the field loses potential energy.</li>\n<li><strong>Key Idea:</strong> Potential energy depends on <em>both</em> the charge and the electric field it&#39;s in.</li>\n</ul>\n"
