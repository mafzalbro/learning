    "title": "Electric Charge: The Basics",
    "content": "<ul>\n<li>Electric charge is a fundamental property of matter.</li>\n<li>There are two types of charge:<ul>\n<li><strong>Positive (+)</strong> (carried by protons in the nucleus of an atom)</li>\n<li><strong>Negative (-)</strong> (carried by electrons orbiting the nucleus)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Like charges repel, and opposite charges attract.</li>\n</ul>\n"

    "title": "Charging by Friction (Triboelectric Effect)",
    "content": "<p>When two different materials are rubbed together, electrons can be transferred from one material to the other.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One material becomes positively charged (loses electrons).</li>\n<li>The other material becomes negatively charged (gains electrons).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Example: Rubbing a balloon on your hair.</em></p>\n"

    "title": "Charging by Conduction",

  {
    "title": "Charging by Induction",
    "content": "<p>Charging by induction is charging an object without direct contact.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A charged object is brought near a neutral object.</li>\n<li>This causes a separation of charge within the neutral object.</li>\n<li>The neutral object is grounded, allowing electrons to flow either in or out of it.</li>\n<li>The ground is removed, and then the charged object is removed, leaving the neutral object charged.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>Example: Charging a metal sphere with a negatively charged rod without touching it.</em></p>\n"

    "title": "Coulomb's Law: Quantifying the Force",
    "content": "<p>Coulomb&#39;s Law describes the electrostatic force between two point charges:</p>\n<p>F = k * |q1 * q2| / r^2</p>\n<p>Where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>F is the electrostatic force.</li>\n<li>k is Coulomb&#39;s constant (approximately 8.99 x 10^9 N⋅m²/C²).</li>\n<li>q1 and q2 are the magnitudes of the charges.</li>\n<li>r is the distance between the charges.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Important points:\n*The force is attractive if the charges have opposite signs.\n*The force is repulsive if the charges have the same sign.</p>\n"
