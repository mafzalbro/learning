    "content": "<p>Don&#39;t worry, no deep dives!  Here are the key ideas we&#39;ll need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Quantization:</strong> Energy, like light, comes in discrete packets called <em>quanta</em>.  Think of stairs, not a ramp.</li>\n<li><strong>Wave-Particle Duality:</strong> Particles (like electrons) can act like waves, and waves (like light) can act like particles.</li>\n<li><strong>Superposition:</strong> A quantum system can be in multiple states <em>at the same time</em> until measured. Like a coin spinning in the air.</li>\n<li><strong>Entanglement:</strong> Two particles can be linked together, so knowing the state of one instantly tells you the state of the other, even if they&#39;re far apart.  Spooky action!</li>\n</ul>\n"
