    "title": "What are Electromagnetic Waves?",
    "content": "<p>Electromagnetic waves are disturbances that travel through space, carrying energy.  Think of them as ripples in a pond, but instead of water, it&#39;s made of electric and magnetic fields!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Key Properties:</strong><ul>\n<li><strong>They don&#39;t need a medium:</strong>  They can travel through a vacuum (like space!).</li>\n<li><strong>They travel at the speed of light:</strong>  Approximately 300,000,000 meters per second (c).</li>\n<li><strong>They have both electric and magnetic field components:</strong> These fields oscillate perpendicularly to each other and to the direction of wave propagation.</li>\n<li><strong>They have a frequency and wavelength:</strong> These are inversely related.  Higher frequency = shorter wavelength.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n"

    "title": "Generating Electromagnetic Waves",
    "content": "<p>Electromagnetic waves are created when charged particles accelerate (change velocity). Imagine shaking an electron back and forth!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Accelerating Charges:</strong> The movement of charge creates changing electric fields.</li>\n<li><strong>Changing Electric Fields:</strong>  These changing electric fields, in turn, induce changing magnetic fields.</li>\n<li><strong>The Cycle Continues:</strong> The changing magnetic fields then induce more changing electric fields, and so on. This self-propagating cycle creates the electromagnetic wave that travels through space.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Think of it as pushing someone on a swing - your push (acceleration) creates the swing&#39;s movement (the wave).</p>\n"

Measured in Hertz (Hz).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Relationship:</strong> The speed of light (c) relates wavelength and frequency:  <code>c = λ * f</code></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This means waves with short wavelengths have high frequencies and vice-versa.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n"
