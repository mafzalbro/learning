    "title": "What is Inductance?",
    "content": "<p>Inductance (L) is a property of an electrical circuit that opposes changes in current.</p>\n<p>Think of it like inertia in mechanics: inertia resists changes in motion; inductance resists changes in current flow.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is measured in <strong>Henries (H)</strong>.</li>\n<li>A component designed to have a specific inductance is called an <strong>inductor</strong> or <strong>coil</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n"

    "title": "How Inductance Works: Magnetic Fields",
    "content": "<p>When current flows through a conductor, it creates a magnetic field around it. This is the basis of inductance.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Changing current = Changing magnetic field</li>\n<li>A changing magnetic field induces a voltage (electromotive force or EMF) that opposes the original change in current (Lenz&#39;s Law).</li>\n<li>This induced voltage is called <strong>back EMF</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n"

    "title": "Factors Affecting Inductance",
    "content": "<p>The inductance of a coil depends on several factors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Number of Turns (N):</strong> More turns = higher inductance (L ∝ N²)</li>\n<li><strong>Coil Geometry:</strong> Shape and dimensions of the coil (e.g., length, radius) affect inductance.</li>\n<li><strong>Core Material:</strong> The material inside the coil (e.g., air, iron) significantly impacts inductance.  Iron cores increase inductance.</li>\n<li><strong>Permeability (μ):</strong> A measure of how easily a material supports the formation of a magnetic field.  Higher permeability = higher inductance.</li>\n</ul>\n"
