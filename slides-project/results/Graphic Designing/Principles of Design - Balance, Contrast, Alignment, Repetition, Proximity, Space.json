    "title": "Balance: Creating Stability",
    "content": "<p>Balance refers to the visual weight distribution within a design.</p>\n<p><strong>Types of Balance:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Symmetrical:</strong> Even distribution of elements on both sides of a central axis (formal, stable).</li>\n<li><strong>Asymmetrical:</strong> Uneven distribution of elements (dynamic, informal).</li>\n<li><strong>Radial:</strong> Elements radiate from a central point.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Balance creates a sense of stability and harmony.</p>\n"
  },
  {
    "title": "Example: Symmetrical Balance",
    "content": "<p>Imagine a perfectly centered logo on a poster. The left and right sides mirror each other, creating a feeling of formality and equilibrium.</p>\n<p>[Insert Image of a symmetrically balanced design here - e.g., a centered logo with text equally distributed on either side]</p>\n"
  },
  {
    "title": "Example: Asymmetrical Balance",
    "content": "<p>Picture a website with a large image on the left and a block of text on the right.  Balance is achieved by using the visual weight of the image to offset the text, even though they are not identical.</p>\n<p>[Insert Image of an asymmetrically balanced design here - e.g., a large photo balanced by a text block with a call to action]</p>\n"
  },
  {
    "title": "Contrast: Making Things Pop",
    "content": "<p>Contrast is the difference between elements in a design.</p>\n<p><strong>Using Contrast:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Color:</strong> Light vs. Dark, Warm vs. Cool.</li>\n<li><strong>Size:</strong> Large vs. Small.</li>\n<li><strong>Shape:</strong> Geometric vs. Organic.</li>\n<li><strong>Typeface:</strong> Serif vs. Sans-serif.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Contrast creates visual interest and highlights important information.</p>\n"

    "title": "Example: Color Contrast",
    "content": "<p>A bright yellow button on a dark blue background immediately grabs the user&#39;s attention.  The high contrast makes the button stand out.</p>\n<p>[Insert Image of high color contrast - e.g., a yellow button on a dark blue background]</p>\n"

    "title": "Example: Size Contrast",
    "content": "<p>Using a very large headline font compared to the body text emphasizes the importance of the headline and guides the reader&#39;s eye.</p>\n<p>[Insert image showing a large headline font contrasting with smaller body text]</p>\n"
  },
  {
    "title": "Alignment: Creating Order",
    "content": "<p>Alignment refers to the arrangement of elements along a common axis or baseline.</p>\n<p><strong>Types of Alignment:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Left Alignment:</strong> Common for body text (easy to read).</li>\n<li><strong>Right Alignment:</strong> Can be used sparingly for emphasis.</li>\n<li><strong>Center Alignment:</strong> Best for headings and short blocks of text.</li>\n<li><strong>Justified Alignment:</strong> Evenly spaced text that fills the entire width (use with caution!).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alignment provides structure and readability.</p>\n"

  {
    "title": "Good Alignment vs. Bad Alignment",
    "content": "<p>Notice how well-aligned elements create a sense of order and professionalism. Poor alignment can make a design look messy and unprofessional.</p>\n<p>[Insert Image of good alignment next to a similar design with poor alignment]</p>\n"
  },
  {
    "title": "Repetition: Reinforcing Consistency",
    "content": "<p>Repetition involves using the same elements (colors, fonts, shapes, textures) throughout a design.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits of Repetition:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creates visual unity and consistency.</li>\n<li>Reinforces a brand identity.</li>\n<li>Guides the viewer through the design.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Don&#39;t overdo it though; repetition should be balanced with variety.</p>\n"
  },

    "title": "Example: Repetition of Color",
    "content": "<p>Using the same brand color in the logo, headings, and call-to-action buttons creates a cohesive look and reinforces brand recognition.</p>\n<p>[Insert Image showing repetition of a specific color throughout a design]</p>\n"
  },
  {
    "title": "Example: Repetition of Font",
    "content": "<p>Using the same font family for all headings and a different, but complementary, font family for the body text establishes a consistent and professional tone.</p>\n<p>[Insert Image showing consistent font usage for headings and body text]</p>\n"
  },
  {
    "title": "Proximity: Grouping Related Elements",
    "content": "<p>Proximity refers to the closeness of elements within a design.</p>\n<p><strong>The Principle:</strong> Elements that are related should be placed close together.  Elements that are unrelated should be spaced further apart.</p>\n<p>Proximity helps organize information and makes it easier for viewers to understand the relationships between elements.</p>\n"
  },
  {
    "title": "Example: Proximity in a Navigation Menu",
    "content": "<p>Navigation menu items (Home, About, Services, Contact) are placed close together because they are all related to website navigation.</p>\n<p>[Insert Image of a well-designed navigation menu with clear proximity between the links]</p>\n"

  {
    "title": "Example: Proximity in a Contact Form",
    "content": "<p>The label for each form field (Name, Email, Message) is placed close to the input field so the user knows which label corresponds to which field.</p>\n<p>[Insert image of a well-structured contact form with clear proximity between labels and input fields]</p>\n"
  },
  {
    "title": "Space: The Art of Breathing Room",
    "content": "<p>Space (also called negative space or white space) is the area around and between elements in a design.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits of Space:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improves readability and comprehension.</li>\n<li>Creates a clean and uncluttered look.</li>\n<li>Draws attention to important elements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Don&#39;t be afraid to leave empty space in your designs!</p>\n"
  },
  {
    "title": "Example: Space Around Text",
    "content": "<p>Sufficient space around text makes it easier to read.  Too little space can make the text look cramped and overwhelming.</p>\n<p>[Insert Image of text with good spacing next to the same text with cramped spacing]</p>\n"

  {
    "title": "Example: Space Around Images",
    "content": "<p>Giving an image breathing room allows it to stand out and prevents it from being overwhelmed by surrounding elements.</p>\n<p>[Insert image of an object with proper spacing in the picture]</p>\n"
  },
  {
    "title": "Combining the Principles",
    "content": "<p>These principles work best when used together.  A balanced design might use contrast to highlight key information, while repetition creates consistency and proximity groups related elements.
