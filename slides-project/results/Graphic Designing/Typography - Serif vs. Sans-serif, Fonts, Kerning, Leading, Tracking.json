A general rule is to pair a Serif and a Sans-Serif font.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Choose fonts with different weights and styles.</li>\n<li><strong>Hierarchy:</strong> Use different fonts to create visual hierarchy (e.g., heading vs. body text).</li>\n<li><strong>Readability is Key:</strong> Make sure the combined fonts are still easy to read.

    "content": "<p>Kerning is the adjustment of space between <em>individual</em> letter pairs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Why is it important?</strong>  Poor kerning can make words look unbalanced and difficult to read. Some letter combinations (e.g., AV, WA) often need manual kerning.</li>\n<li><strong>Automatic Kerning:</strong> Most software has automatic kerning, but manual adjustments are often necessary for professional results. The goal is to make the space between all letters optically the same.</li>\n</ul>\n"

    "title": "Leading: Line Height Matters",
    "content": "<p>Leading (pronounced &#39;led-ding&#39;) is the vertical space between lines of text.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Impact on Readability:</strong>  Too little leading makes text feel cramped; too much makes it feel disconnected.</li>\n<li><strong>Optimal Leading:</strong>  Generally, leading should be slightly larger than the font size (e.g., 12pt font, 14pt leading). It should create vertical breathing room for the text. This depends on the font being used.</li>\n</ul>\n"
