    "title": "Raster vs. Vector: The Key Difference",
    "content": "<p>Understanding the core difference is crucial:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Raster Graphics (JPG, PNG, PSD):</strong> Made up of pixels (tiny squares of color). Like a mosaic. When you zoom in, you see the individual pixels. Resolution-dependent â€“ quality degrades when enlarged.</li>\n<li><strong>Vector Graphics (SVG, EPS, AI):</strong> Defined by mathematical equations, paths, and shapes.  Like drawing with geometric tools.  Scalable without loss of quality.  Resolution-independent.</li>\n</ul>\n"

    "content": "<ul>\n<li><strong>What is it?</strong> A widely used format for photographs and images with complex colors.</li>\n<li><strong>Lossy:</strong>  Reduces file size by discarding some image data.  More compression = smaller file = lower quality.</li>\n<li><strong>Best for:</strong> Photographs, images where file size is important.</li>\n<li><strong>Not ideal for:</strong> Logos, text, graphics with sharp lines (lossy compression can cause artifacts).</li>\n</ul>\n"
