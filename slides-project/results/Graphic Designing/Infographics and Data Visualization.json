    "content": "<p><strong>Infographics:</strong> Visual representations of information, data, or knowledge intended to present complex information quickly and clearly.</p>\n<p><strong>Data Visualizations:</strong> Graphical representations of data. They use visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps to help people understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Difference:</strong> Infographics often combine data visualizations with other visual elements like icons, illustrations, and text to tell a complete story. Data visualizations are usually a component of the entire infographic.</p>\n"
