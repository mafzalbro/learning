  {
    "title": "What are Graphic Design Trends?",
    "content": "<p>Graphic design trends are the popular styles, techniques, and aesthetics that are currently being widely adopted by designers. They influence everything from website layouts to logos and advertising.</p>\n"
  },
  {
    "title": "Minimalism: The Art of Less",
    "content": "<p>Minimalism focuses on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Stripping away unnecessary elements.</li>\n<li><strong>Clean Lines:</strong> Using clear and defined shapes.</li>\n<li><strong>Negative Space:</strong> Utilizing empty areas for emphasis.</li>\n<li><strong>Limited Color Palettes:</strong> Often using 2-3 colors or monochrome schemes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Think of it as Marie Kondo for your design!</p>\n"
  },
  {
    "title": "Examples of Minimalism",
    "content": "<ul>\n<li>Simple logos with just a few lines.</li>\n<li>Websites with lots of white space and minimal text.</li>\n<li>Posters with a single strong image and minimal typography.</li>\n</ul>\n"
  },
  {
    "title": "Flat Design: No Depth, All Clarity",
    "content": "<p>Flat design eschews three-dimensional effects like shadows, gradients, and textures. It emphasizes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Solid Colors:</strong> Bold and vibrant hues.</li>\n<li><strong>Simple Shapes:</strong> Geometric forms and icons.</li>\n<li><strong>Usability:</strong> Easy to understand and navigate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Think of it like a vector illustration brought to life.</p>\n"

  },
  {
    "title": "Skeuomorphism: Mimicking Reality",
    "content": "<p>Skeuomorphism designs elements to resemble real-world objects. Examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Leather textures on calendar apps.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Shadows on buttons to make them appear &#39;clickable&#39;.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Page-turning animations in e-readers.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n"
  },
  {
    "title": "The Rise and Fall of Skeuomorphism",
    "content": "<p>Skeuomorphism was popular when digital interfaces were new, helping users understand digital functions by relating them to familiar objects. Now, users are more familiar with digital interfaces so less inclined to skeuomorphism. For instance, the camera icon in every phone resembles a real life camera in hopes of teaching users the function of the button when the smart phone was first designed.</p>\n"
