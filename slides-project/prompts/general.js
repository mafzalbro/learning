const prompt = {
    text: `create a json for the slide content with the topic - Computer Science
    Looks like this:
    [
        {
            "title": "title of the slide",
            "content": "content of the slide with all formating like list and headings etc."
        },
        {
            "title": "title of the slide",

            "content": "content of the slide with all formating like list and headings etc."
        },
        {
            "title": "title of the slide",

            "content": "content of the slide with all formating like list and headings etc." 
        }
        ]

        atleast 10 and atmost 30 slides and may
        first slide will be a title slide That will be the title of the presentation and it's content will be what we are going to cover!!!
        must remember that content must be very easiest one and simple to understand for noobs and advanced users
